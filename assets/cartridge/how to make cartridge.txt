Copy snes_cart_template.png and rename it to cart_<yourgameid>.png 

Photoshop your game title sticker on the new cartridge image.

Use the python script gencart.py to generate a model file for your cartridge 
image.

Usage: gencart.py <yourgameid>

cart_<yourgameid>.smd and cart_<yourgameid>.qc will be generated.

Pass the qc file to Valve's studiomdl program to compile it into the source game files.

e.g. "C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\bin\studiomdl" -game "C:\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo" cart_<yourgameid>.qc
